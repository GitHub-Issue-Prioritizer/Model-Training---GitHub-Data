# Model Training GitHub-Data
The data is trained and tested on the following Machine Learning Models:

1. Random Forest
2. SVM
3. Decision Trees
4. NaÃ¯ve Bayes

->Moreover we will be working with Semi-Supervised learning technique for more accuracy as it will be helpful in dealing with the unlabelled data.
